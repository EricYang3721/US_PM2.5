The names of the figures and code are correspoding to each specific questions below. 

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all 
sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. (plot1.R, plot1.png)

Yes, total emission decreased from 1999 to 2008.

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510")
 from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.  (plot2.R, plot2.png)

Yes. From 1999 to 2008, it decreased. 

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) 
variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for 
Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting 
system to make a plot answer this question.

points increases from 1999 to 2005, but decreased in 2008. Others generally keeps decreasing from 1999 to 208.

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

It decreased from 1999 - 2008.

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

It fluctuates. Not obviously decreased.

6.Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle 
sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time 
in motor vehicle emissions?

Los Angeles.
